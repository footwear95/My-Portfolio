            		<p>My name is Fila Bates and I am a junior at Columbia College Chicago. I will be graduating with a degree in Graphic Design Web Page/Multimedia in Spring of 2019. I am skilled in Photoshop,Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects, Flash, and Animate. I also have experience with HTML, Dreamweaver and Javascript. Once I graduate I would love to find a job where I can design logo and brand identites for corportations and upcoming companies.Ever since I was a little kid I have always loved drawing and designing various things from characters, to designs. My dream has always been to become a video game designer. I have tailored my classes so that I could learn all things about design from creating identities to learning how to code in C++. I was born in Michigan City, Indiana a little town within Laporte County. I come from a big family I am the youngest and only brother to six sisters, I have an adorable Miniature Schnauzer by the name of Chole. When I am not working on projects for school, I am working full time in Columbia's Library. In my spare time I love to draw, watch movies, play with my dog, and spend quality time with my family.
